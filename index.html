    <h1>Zetaphor's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>The following is a list of open source projects I've worked on over the years.</p>
    <p>Not everything in the list is necessarily finished, may are just proofs of concept or the minimum viable product.
    </p>
    <p>I build a lot of these things to get an idea out of my head, play with a new tool, or to solve my own problem.
    </p>
    <p>This list excludes pull requests to other open source projects, only my own original repositories are listed
      unless otherwise noted.</p>
    <p>This list is sorted by most recent project first.</p>

          interactive experiences.</p>

          Javascript.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Completed.</strong> The project is fully functional and includes an example for responding to browser
          interactions using natural language scripting. The documentation still needs to be overhauled.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">This is a fork of an existing extension for the Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 WebUI. I
          included this fork in this list as I made quite a few modifications in the effort of performing weight
          relationship analysis. This included adding functionality to built a pickle that contains the weight vector
          for
          every token in the stable diffusion tokenizer. Additionally you can visually map the relationship between one
          or
          more tokens to aid in tweening and fine-tuning embeddings.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Completed.</strong> The functionality is present and I had a lot of fun turning cats into rats
          without
          prompting.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">This is an extension for the Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 WebUI (and derivates) that
          provdes a more robust interface for prompt management and sharing. It provides functionality for prompt
          history
          and bookmarking, as well as the ability to import and export prompts as JSON.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Completed, but deprecated.</strong> The functionality addon is fully functional, but has been broken
          by
          newer versions of the A1111 UI. There are alternative extensions now tha that provide this functionality.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">This is a hosted text to speech service for the Neos/Resonite virtual world platform. The
          original TTS project that was widely used was hosted on the free Heroku tier by Tessacoil, that tier was
          removed
          in late 2022. I developed this fork to take over the project and keep it running.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Complete.</strong> The server remains online despite me no longer actively using Neos or Resonite. I
          intend to keep it online indefinitely.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">This server is meant to provide a full physics engine for the creative virtual world
          platform Neos/Resonite. The physics engine runs locally and forwards the state of all objects to a Neos
          rendering client via websockets. There is also a Three.js based viewer implemented for debugging collision
          geometries.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Incomplete.</strong> The server and browser interface are complete. I ran into issues with Neos and
          its
          websocket client when it came to the frequency of simulation updates.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p class="description">This was a project to replace the Pebble Appstore after the company shut down operations.
          This project eventually went on to become the foundation for the Rebble appstore which is still operating
          today.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Complete.</strong> This has since been migrated to the Rebble organization.</p>

        <p class="description">This was an attempt at creating an AI assistant that could be commanded using natural
          language via speech to text.</p>
        <h4>Status</h4>
        <p><strong>Deprecreated.</strong> This was functional, but Wit.ai no longer offers the same API. Now LLMs can do
          a better job of offering this capability.</p>
